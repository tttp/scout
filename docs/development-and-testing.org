As well as the production environment, scout can help you manage your
testing (staging?) and development environments.

* testing
Scout assumes that your testing server will be one machine which is
accessed by various projects.  As such all projects on a test server
are run under a user of the same name

* development
Scout assumes that development happens on your local machine.

* syncing
There are three different aspects that need to be synchronised: db,
files, and code.

There are two places that we want to sync: test and local/dev
